# Janguage

> Early work in progress!

Janguage is a programming language invented by me.

Don't ask me what this is gonna be good for except for the learning process I am making through while writing this!

More information about the language will follow soon.

> Since I am currently looking for a new job:
> If you are a potential employer, please note that this is a hobby project of mine and I am deliberately breaking many rules of modern/'clean' C++ programming for the sake of 'just getting it done' for now.
> There will be cleanups and refactorings at some point.
